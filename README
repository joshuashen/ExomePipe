WEPL: WGS and Exome PipeLine

Computation pipeline for analyzing WGS and Exome data.

Major modules:
1. mapping reads onto human reference in batches, using BWA
2. collecting mapping results, init GATK
3. iterative preliminary analysis: remapping for indels, indel/SNP calling, using GATK
4. finalize variant calling. Quality assessment: false positive (known SNPs %; transition/transversion)
5. association test: (1) single variants, Fisher's exact test. (2) grouping by genes or pathways for 
 rare and/or functional variants. Considering double hits (potentially compound heterzygosity), recessive, etc
