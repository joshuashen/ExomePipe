- 10/19/2010: genome reference and GATK
GATK is picky about the genome reference -- it requires that the chromosome 
order is the same between the reference used for mapping and the reference 
used for variant calling. BAM files from different genome centers were likely 
made using different reference fasta files even for same build. So we must get
the reference fasta files from all three centers. Here is a list of the 
reference files:

  Homo_sapiens_assembly18.fasta  # hg18 used by Broad
  wu_build36.fasta               # build 36 used by WU
  bcm_hg18.fasta                 # hg18 used by BCM
  human_g1k_v37.fasta            # build 37 used by 1000 genomes project

all under directory: /ifs/data/c2b2/ip_lab/shares/DATA/Sequencing/resources/


- 10/12/2010: add VT Test code
VT Test implement methods mentioned in Price et al 2010. We downloaded the R 
code from http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/rare_variants/. Note: the input 
requires polyphen-2 scores, which can be obtained from: 
 http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/bgi.shtml 


- 10/07/2010: update GATK to latest version
1. do a new svn checkout
  svn co https://svnrepos.broadinstitute.org/Sting/trunk Sting
  "svn update" on old repository won't necessary work during compilation.  
2. cd Sting; ant  # which is to compile
3. "ant play" doesn't work for this version. Perhaps experimental walkers are 
  now stable.  
4. rsync -az . yshen@login.c2b2.columbia.edu:/ifs/data/c2b2/ip_lab/shares/SOFTWARE/Sting/
