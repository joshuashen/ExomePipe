10/07/2010: update GATK to latest version
1. do a new svn checkout (svn co https://svnrepos.broadinstitute.org/Sting/trunk Sting). "svn update" on old repository won't necessary work during compilation.  
2. cd Sting; ant  # which is to compile
3. "ant play" doesn't work for this version. Perhaps experimental walkers are now stable.  
4. rsync -az . yshen@login.c2b2.columbia.edu:/ifs/data/c2b2/ip_lab/shares/SOFTWARE/Sting/
